  <div class="section">
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Storage:</strong> To-Duck List stores all your task data locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API.
      We do not collect, store, or transmit your task data to any external servers.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information. We implement 
      appropriate technical measures to protect your data within the extension, but the security of your data ultimately 
      depends on your device's security.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <p>
      We request only the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function properly. We do not request permissions 
      to access your browsing history, website data, or other sensitive information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
